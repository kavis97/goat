                    For the next academic year, we want to improve our transportation facilities that will attract and facilitate more students. We require at least two minibuses for this purpose.
By June 2020, we want to start the work for a school building.
We are looking for suitable land to begin building the holiday village.
The total cost for the above will come around Â£750,000.
We aim to increase our regular giving partner base and raise funds to complete the building and transportation costs, as mentioned above.
