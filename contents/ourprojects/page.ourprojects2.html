<h2>New Grace School</h2>
<p>
    We will offer a system where learning is fun, and there is no pressure for children or parents. By providing proven Montessori education, we will be avoiding the use of traditional style textbooks and homework system. We will be keeping this to the very minimum, if not avoiding them altogether. The curriculum will involve teaching drawing, art, music and drama. All children will have opportunities to perform in front of their families at least twice a year.

    We aim to bring in motivational speakers to speak to Children and parents to encourage them to value life and to look away from stress and strain of education. Speakers include police officers, doctors, political and religious ministers.

    While providing a haven for children to learn practically, we will be delivering and modelling love and care for all through our institutionâ€™s culture.  It must attract youngsters keeping them away from extremism.

    We want to provide the children with excellent international education so that it carries value everywhere in the world. We want to pioneer in teaching children from a young age to know Christ, be born-again, to grow up in the word of God.

    They can then go into their mountain of influence - Government, Media, Arts and Entertainment, Business, Education, Religion and Family and share Jesus in their sphere of influence.

    That is a way how children can grow up to become true disciples of Jesus and lead others to become one too.
