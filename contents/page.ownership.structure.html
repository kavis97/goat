    In the UK, we have registered a limited charitable company, New Grace Community. It is linked with a Barclays community account. This will help us raise funds for any charity purpose in India, including educating the poor and supporting any compassion purposes. New Grace Community Project in India is  supported under the Charity Umbrella of Links International , who provides us with the benefits of being a small charity and helps claim gift aid and transfer money to accounts. This has made it more transparent and legitimate to our partners to see that we are functioning as a charity in the UK, making it easier for our partners to support us.
