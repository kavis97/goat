<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>We are a Christian Charity based in South India, to provide excellent mainstream education to all children. Despite their social status, economic status, religious state or race, we will be serving them to grow up as responsible citizens. </p>
<p>Our values are based on the Word of God and sharing the Good news that Jesus died for all our mistakes, has conquered death, restored the broken father-child relationship between God and us humans and is alive today. </p>
<p>The vision we have is to build a community that will stand and shine with the powerful light of the truth that Jesus is alive and loves everyone.</p>
<p>From birth to old age, we want to serve, care and release people to live freely under Jesus.</p>
