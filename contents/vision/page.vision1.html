<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>
    To provide an excellent education to children rooted in Christian values from the word of God. 
</p>
<p>
    Children will learn all mainstream subjects. Religious education and sciences will be based on what the Bible teaches rather than how the world portrays it. We aim to train the children from nursery age of around three years onwards. We will give them excellent education while helping them to believe in Jesus and learn the word of God and thrive in their day to day life in relationship with Jesus through the Holy Spirit. They should be able to soar on new heights and achieve greater things for the kingdom of God.

    “But those who trust in the LORD will find new strength. They will soar high on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They will walk and not faint.” [Isaiah 40:31 (NLT)]
