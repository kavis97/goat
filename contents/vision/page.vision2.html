<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>
    Build a University and a growing community through holiday villages, old age and children's homes, hospitals. This will be based in Tekulagudem, near Mahabubabad. Share the love of Christ in words, acts and thoughts towards everyone. Through providing excellent mainstream education rooted in Christian values, we will spread the good news of Jesus to children and help them grow in the Word of God.

    Children can take the values to their families, and through the families, they will impact their communities, villages, town and cities.  Staff members will grow in the word of God and share the Gospel by living and modelling it to everyone around them.

    Build a whole community around the school that will grow together to a University in Jesus Christ. Generations and nations are going to be impacted through these lives transformed in Jesus Christ.
