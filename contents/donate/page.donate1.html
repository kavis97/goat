    All your giving will go into a common bucket and we use the money for the needs of the ministry. This includes paying salaries for staff, maintaining building, Government fees, textbooks and accessories, school celebrations throughout the year; also travel and accommodation expenses for ministry purposes, pastor’s training (sharing and caring), supporting poor families with food and other needs.  If you have been giving specifically for a need, we make sure that it goes towards that specific need. So, if you would like your giving to go to a specific need, please do let us know with different references as mentioned in the next paragraph.
