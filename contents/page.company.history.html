<h2>Company history</h2>
<p>
    PECS in India was established in 2007. Under PECS, we started Prathyaasa Vidyalaya as a tutoring centre for underprivileged children in the remote village of Tekulagudem, 15kms away from Mahabubabad in Telangana (previously was under Andhra Pradesh). 
</p>
<p>
    We employed a teacher to help around 40 children free of cost. Eventually, in 2010, we constructed a small building and started Nireekshana Vidyalaya. This school grew in numbers and popularity. In 2010, we had over 150 students and ten full-time staff members.

    Unfortunately, in the same year, our Principal, Mr Vinay Paul, passed away in a tragic road accident. It took almost a year for us to find a replacement and also due to political and social issues plagued with staffing issues, we had to make some radical decisions. 
</p>
<p>
    We introduced the Montessori system and restarted the school under the name, “New Grace School” as a seed towards “New Grace University”.
</p>
<p>
    Since 2007, when this mission started as a one-room school, we have provided excellent education to around 2000 children, out of whom about 400 children were offered free education.
</p>
<p>
    We currently have about 55 children. Four of them are provided free education, including school uniform, textbooks and accessories. We have students enrolled from Kindergarten till Standard 3 (Reception to Year 2). 
</p>
<p>
    There are nine full-time staff members. One public relations officer, six teachers and two non-teaching staff members.

    In 2019, New Grace community was established in the UK. We are under Links International Charity, who provides us with the charity umbrella.
